How to play Shut the Box

At the start of the game all levers or tiles are "open" (cleared, up), showing the numerals 1 to 9.

A player begins their turn by throwing or rolling the die or dice into the box. If all of the remaining tiles show 6 or lower, the player may roll only one die.

After throwing, the player adds up (or subtracts) the pips (dots) on the dice and then "shuts" (closes, covers) one of any combination of open numbers that sums to the total number of dots showing on the dice. For example, if the total number of dots is 8, the player may choose any of the following sets of numbers (as long as all of the numbers in the set are available to be covered):

8
7, 1
6, 2
5, 3
5, 2, 1
4, 3, 1
The player then rolls the dice again, aiming to shut more numbers. The player continues throwing the dice and shutting numbers until reaching a point at which, given the results produced by the dice, the player cannot shut any more numbers. At that point, the player scores the sum of the numbers that are still uncovered. For example, if the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are still open when the player throws a one, the player's score is 10 (2 + 3 + 5 = 10). P

The goal of the game is to get the lowest score. 

If a player succeeds in closing all of the numbers, that player is said to have "Shut the Box" â€“ the player wins immediately and the game is over.'
